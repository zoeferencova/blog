## Summary

Tada is a simple blog application built using Next.js. The app uses Hygraph, a headless CMS based on GraphQL technology, to handle content editing and storage. The blog has support for full markdown articles, commenting functionality, and sections for informational "learning" pages and data viz resources.

Content-wise, I wanted a place to document my learning in the world of data visualization, a field that I am very fond of. I write about data viz books I read, visualization projects I'm working on, and tutorials on topics that I want to take a closer look at. I also try to regularly participate in the R community's weekly Tidy Tuesday challenge, using Python and D3 to bring my visualizations to the web.

## Technologies Used

* Next.js
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* GraphQL + Hygraph CMS
